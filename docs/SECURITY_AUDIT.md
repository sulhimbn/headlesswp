# Repository Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive security audit of the HeadlessWP repository and outlines the implemented security measures.

## Current Security Status

### ✅ Implemented Security Measures
- **Security Policy**: Comprehensive security policy documented in `SECURITY.md`
- **CODEOWNERS**: Proper code ownership configuration
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates configured
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch is protected
- **Security Workflows**: Automated security scanning implemented
- **Hardened Runners**: Step Security hardening enabled in workflows

### 🔧 Security Improvements Implemented

#### 1. Automated Security Scanning
- **Security Audit Workflow** (`security-workflows.yml`)
  - Weekly npm audit scans
  - Dependency vulnerability checks
  - Automated security reports
  - TruffleHog OSS secret detection
  - Static code analysis (to be added with proper permissions)

Note: CodeQL and dedicated secret scanning workflows require GitHub Advanced Security features and special workflow permissions. These will be implemented when the repository has the required permissions.

#### 2. Enhanced Workflow Security
- All workflows use `step-security/harden-runner@v2`
- Proper permission scoping for workflows
- Egress policy auditing enabled

#### 3. Documentation Structure
- Created `docs/` directory for comprehensive documentation
- Security audit reporting system

## Security Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Enable GitHub Advanced Security** (if available)
   - Full Dependabot alerts
   - Enhanced code scanning
   - Secret scanning

2. **Configure Branch Protection Rules**
   - Require PR reviews
   - Require status checks
   - Enforce admin restrictions

### Medium Priority
1. **Implement Security Testing**
   - Add security unit tests
   - Penetration testing workflow

2. **Enhance Dependency Management**
   - Automated vulnerability patching
   - License compliance checking

## Security Metrics

- **Repository**: Public
- **Security Policy**: ✅ Enabled
- **Branch Protection**: ✅ Main branch protected
- **Dependabot**: ✅ Configured
- **Code Scanning**: ⚠️ TruffleHog implemented (CodeQL pending permissions)
- **Secret Scanning**: ✅ TruffleHog implemented
- **Security Workflows**: ✅ 1 comprehensive workflow with 3 jobs

## Compliance

- **GDPR**: Data protection measures implemented
- **Security Best Practices**: Following OWASP guidelines
- **GitHub Security**: Implementing recommended security features

## Next Steps

1. Monitor security scan results
2. Address any identified vulnerabilities
3. Regular security reviews (quarterly)
4. Update security documentation as needed
